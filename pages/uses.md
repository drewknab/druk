### Workspace

I use a cheap desk, a pretty good chair, and a budget monitor.

- [Computer Desk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N02RF6D)

  It's an okay desk. It's deep enough and 55" is wide enough for my needs.
- [Techorbits Three Monitor Stand Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075SRGSK1)

    It's a little bit floppy and the lack of articulation in the center post is a little annoying, but it's held up well.
- [Amazon Basics Laptop Tray](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QZD6I6) * 2

    I live a double laptop life, this makes that clean.
- [Lenovo ThinkPad Mini Dock Series 3](https://www.newegg.com/lenovo-4337-10u/p/N82E16834988417)

    Huge quality of life improvement when I want to work in a Linux environment.
- [HyperX Cloud 2](https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Gaming-Headset-KHX-HSCP-GM/dp/B00SAYCVTQ)

    It's a headset. It's comfy. The sound quality is fine.
- [Secret Labs Titan XL](https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-xl-series#titan_xl_2020_softweave-black3)

    It's a comfy chair for big folks. I am a big folk.

### Computers

I split my time between two laptops.

- [15" Macbook Pro Mid 2014](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp704)

    It's still a great laptop and it doesn't suffer from any of the weird design decisions of later models.
- [Lenovo ThinkPad X220](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd015812-detailed-specifications-thinkpad-x220)

    Ten years on this laptop is still an absolute beast.

### Mice

- [Razor Deathadder V2](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B082G5SPR5) - Current

    Recently switched to this after my MX Master thumb button started acting up and loosening/tightening the daughter board wasn't cutting it anymore.
- [Logitech MX Master 2](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Master-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B071YZJ1G1)

    Great productivity mouse, I love the ergonomics and programmability.
- [Logitech Trackman](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Trackman-Marble-Four-Button-Programmable/dp/B001F42MKG)

    I actually love the form factor and really prefer it style to the M570, unfortunately wireless alternatives are way more expensive than I'm willing to drop on a temporary mouse.
- [Logitech M570](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-M570-Wireless-Trackball-Mouse/dp/B0042BBR2S)

    I use this if I end up having wrist pain and I don't want to deal with wires.

### Keyboard

- [HHKB Profesional 2 Type-S](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Hacking-Keyboard-Professional2-White/dp/B000EXZ0V2)

    It's really expensive for what it is, but I really like it. Sorry, I'm a Topre apologist.
- [WASD VP3 61 Key MX Green](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-vp3-61-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html)

    MX Green was maybe not the best decision. It's loud as hell and is a repetative strain issue waiting to happen. Kinda still like it though.
- [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business-5KV-00001/dp/B00CYX26BC)

    I break this out if I'm having pains where I shouldn't have pains. It's okay, someday I'd like something similar with mechanical switches.

### Editors

I have a heirarchy of editor choices.

- Vim

    My go to is Vim (gvim if I'm on windows).
- Neovim

    I recently started testing this out when I'm writing F# code, I don't hate it.
- Visual Studio Code (with a Vim plugin)

    If I need something that I don't have/would be a pain to setup in Vim, I'll switch to VSCode.

    Example: TypeScript, C#, basically anything with an abundance of user defined static types.
- Visual Studio 20XX (with a Vim plugin)

    I use this for the day job. It's more or less a necessity.

### Command Lines

#### MacOS
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

    Personally, still the gold standard of MacOS terminal emulators.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

    I finally gave up Bash. I held out as long as I could.

#### *NIX
- [st](https://st.suckless.org/)

    The more annoying it is to update my terminal config the less likely I am to do it. Theoretically, this means getting more things done.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

    I held out as long as I could. It's just convenient.

#### Windows
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) - Current

    This is actually really useful for managing multiple command line contexts. Personally, I prefer it over other solutions like [cmder](cmder.net).
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

    I mostly use this when I do anything in the CLI on Windows.
- [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

    Ubuntu flavor. I will typically use this when I need to do something in Node.
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

    Mostly abandoned now that I have Windows Terminal.

### Linux/*NIX and Window Managers

I'm trying to be better about distro hopping

- Debian - Current

    It's fine. I switched to it for better .NET Core support out of the box.
- Manjaro

    Ubuntu for Arch. I kind of miss the AUR and the rolling releases. May go back to it someday.
- FreeBSD

    I haven't used it in a long time, but I'm tempted to go back to it.
- i3

    It's the easiest tiling manager to get started with. Maybe someday I'll switch to XMonad, but why?

### Guitars
- Fender Telecaster

    Arctic White from 2006, made in Mexico. I love this guitar. Truly a workhorse.
- Takamine EG530C

    It has seen better days it was beat up when I traded a 2004 Silvertone SG Clone for it and I've only beat it up more.
- Squire Affinity PJ Bass

    Most recent purchase. It certainly is a bass guitar. Honestly, I really like it for what it is.
